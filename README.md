This code contains the algorithm for mathematical template matching methods such as Normalized Cross Correlation, Correlation Coefficient, and SSD which are used to identify elements of an image, such as detecting cancer cells in CAT scans
 
 There are 3 files which contain the code for the three template matching techniques, and a main file that combines these three files and runs the main program
